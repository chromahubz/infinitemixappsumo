# InfiniteMix Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue
Railway was showing the `/app` software page instead of the AppSumo landing page at root `/`.

## Root Cause Analysis
The Next.js routing was already correct:
- `app/page.tsx` → Root `/` (AppSumo landing - 67KB file) ✅
- `app/app/page.tsx` → `/app` route (InfiniteMix software) ✅

The issue was likely:
1. Railway cached an old deployment
2. Browser cached the wrong page
3. Railway's build cache needed clearing

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Explicit Middleware (`middleware.ts`)
- Logs all route requests for debugging
- Ensures root `/` always serves landing page
- Explicitly handles `/app` route to software

### 2. Updated Health Check (`app/api/health/route.ts`)
- Added version number (1.0.1) to track deployments
- Shows route configuration
- Helps verify Railway is running the latest build

## Deployment Steps

### On Railway:

1. **Commit and push these changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix routing: ensure / shows AppSumo landing"
   git push
   ```

2. **Force rebuild on Railway:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click on your InfiniteMix service
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "..." menu on latest deployment
   - Select "Redeploy" (this forces a fresh build)

3. **Clear Railway cache (optional):**
   - In Railway settings, you can trigger a clean rebuild
   - Or add `RAILWAY_FORCE_REBUILD=true` as env var temporarily

4. **Verify deployment:**
   - Visit `https://infinitemix.app/api/health`
   - Check that `version` shows `1.0.1`
   - Check that `routes.root` shows correct info

5. **Test the routes:**
   - `https://infinitemix.app/` → Should show AppSumo landing
   - `https://infinitemix.app/app` → Should show InfiniteMix software

6. **Clear browser cache:**
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
   - Or open in incognito/private window

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Health endpoint shows version 1.0.1
- [ ] Root `/` shows AppSumo landing page
- [ ] `/app` shows InfiniteMix software
- [ ] No redirects occurring
- [ ] Middleware logs visible in Railway logs

## Monitoring

Check Railway logs for middleware output:
```
[Middleware] Path: /
[Middleware] Path: /app
```

This confirms routing is working as expected.

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist, the problem is likely:
1. Railway environment configuration
2. Custom domain DNS settings (if applicable)
3. Railway's proxy/load balancer caching

Contact Railway support if the issue continues after rebuild.
